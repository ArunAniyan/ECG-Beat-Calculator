# ECG-Beat-Calculator
Matlab Code to Calculate Heart Rate from ECG Signal 

This program calculates the beats per minute of of an ECG signal. The data file can be any text format. The output will be an averaged value, since normal ecg of a person is not always constant. There maybe drifts and variations. The percentage error for six seconds of the ecg will be 60/sampling frequency.
